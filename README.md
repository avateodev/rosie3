--- ROSIE ODENKIRK PROJECT ---

    1. Description

Rosie Odenkirk is a Front End website I built for my portofolio. It was built using HTML, CSS, Bootsrap and JavaScript and it's for a fictional Full Stack Web Developer
called Rosie Odenkirk for employers to contact her should they wish to hire her for web development projects. The website has a responsive design being aesthetically displayed
on all screen sizes.

    2. UX
    
The website contains six web pages, a home page, a contact page that contains a form to contact Rosie and assign her projects, an intersts page and a resume page detailing Rosie's work history
as well as other career goals she has achieved. The github pages is meant to redirect the used to her GitHub profile so that the employer can have a look at her repositories and make
themselves familiar with her work. Finally, the 404 page is a back up page that displays an error should anything go wrong with our website.

    3. Deployment and Credits
    
The website has only been published on GitHub pages given that it is a personal project.
The website has been built under guidance from The Code Institute which is where I'm currently studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer and it was the final part of the Front-End
module teaching me how to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create Front-End user centric websites as well as how to integrate APIs in my projects.
